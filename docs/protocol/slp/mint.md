# MINT - Extended Minting Transaction

Subsequent minting transactions of `additional_token_quantity` can be performed by spending the "minting baton" UTXO in a special MINT transaction, described here.
Note that this could be done by someone other than the [GENESIS](/protocol/slp/genesis) issuer, if the baton minting authority had been passed to another address.

As with GENESIS, the MINT allows to end the baton, or further pass on the baton to future mint operations: if `mint_baton_vout` is empty or refers to a nonexistent vout, the transaction is valid but the baton is lost.
This makes it possible to prove end-of-minting capabilities for a token even after several minting events (it is impossible to duplicate this baton as that would require double-spending the transaction output associated with the baton).

**Transaction inputs**: Any number of inputs or content of inputs, in any order, but with required presence of a 'baton' input (see [Consensus Rules](/protocol/slp#consensus-rules)).

**Transaction outputs**:

| v<sub>out</sub> | ScriptPubKey ("Address") | BCH amount | Implied token amount (base units) |
|--|--|--|--|
| 0 | OP_RETURN<br>&lt; lokad_id: 'SLP\x00'&gt; (4 bytes, ascii)<br>&lt; token_type: 1&gt; (1 to 2 byte integer)<br>&lt; transaction_type: 'MINT'&gt; (4 bytes, ascii)<br>&lt; token_id&gt; (32 bytes)<br>&lt; mint_baton_vout&gt; (0 bytes or 1 byte between 0x02-0xff)<br>&lt; additional_token_quantity&gt; (8 byte integer) | any | 0 |
| 1 | Token mint receiver | any | additional_token_quantity |
| ... | Any | any | 0 |
| M | Mint baton receiver (M=mint_baton_vout) | any | 0 + 'baton' |
| ... | Any | any | 0 |
